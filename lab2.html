    <p>"Will Not Disrupt": What Irfan Pathan Thinks Of Rahul Dravid And Virat Kohli Working TogetherIND vs NZ: Speaking on the eve of the first Test, former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan shared his views on the much-talked about partnership between new head coach Rahul Dravid and skipper Virat Kohli.

    <q>Pathan feels the Dravid-Kohli partnership will work wonders for IndiaPathan said there will be great a understanding between Dravid and KohlVirat Kohli will play the second Test at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai</q>

    After the Rohit Sharma-led Team India clean-swept New Zealand in the three-match T20I series, the focus now shifts to a two-match Test series between the two sides. This will be Rahul Dravid's first Test series as head coach of the Indian team. With the T20I series done and dusted, Dravid will hope that his team can replicate its T20 form in the upcoming Test series, starting November 25. While Ajinkya Rahane will captain the team in the first Test at the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur, regular captain Virat Kohli will resume his duties in the second Test at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.</p>

    <p>"This will be a new partnership between Rahul Dravid as well as Virat Kohli, the captain. Especially in the longer format, I don't see any problem because Rahul Dravid is a kind of guy who likes to come into the system, he doesn't change the system much," Pathan said during a discussion on Star Sports' ‘Follow The Blues' show.</p>

      <p><b>Manchester United</b> are set to appoint German Ralf Rangnick as interim manager on a six-month contract.The German is unlikely to be in charge for Sunday’s Premier League match against table-toppers Chelsea due to work permit reasons, but he might take charge of the team as manager against Arsenal on December 2.</p>

      <p><em>Manchester United has been searching for an interim manager since the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after the humiliating 4-1 defeat at Watford on Saturday, following a trophyless three-year season at the helm.</em></p>

      <p>Michael Carrick, Solskjaer’s assistant, was placed in temporary charge, with United saying he would be in place while they looked to appoint an interim manager to the end of the season.Carrick took charge of United on Tuesday for the 2-0 win at Villarreal, a result that ensured they would finish top of their Champions League group.</p>

      <p>It was United's lack of any long-term planning which saw them sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer a day after they returned from a two-week international break, acting in haste they identified the need for an interim manager before a permanent appointment can be made.</p>

      <p>Pochettino did little to shy away from the vacant managerial position when he arrived with Paris Saint-Germain to face Man City this week, name-dropping Sir Alex Ferguson in his pre-match press conference and providing cryptic answers about the 'business of football.It is no great secret Pochettino would like to become United manager one day and with so many internal issues to solve before the end of the season there is extra need for an agreement to be reached.</p>

      <p>Following Solskjaer's sacking the recruitment process will continue to be largely overseen by technical chief scout Mick Court, along with the team in the recruitment department, director of football John Murtough and head of corporate development Matt Judge.

       Without a permanent manager in place it is a tougher task to narrow down prime transfer targets given any new appointment could look to implement a new style of play or even use their own personal connections to attract a player who otherwise might not have been under consideration.</p>

    <p>Bhubaneswar, 26 November 2021: After a remarkable 13-1 win over Canada in Group B match of FIH Odisha Hockey Men's Junior World Cup Bhubaneswar 2021, Team India will look to seal a spot in the Quarter Finals when they take on Poland on Saturday.</p>

    <p>Speaking on the importance of the win, Chief Coach Graham Reid stated that it will help the team's mindset ahead of their final Pool match against Poland. "It was really important to get to a good start against Canada and finish away with some good goals. Very important win from the mental perspective ahead of the match against Poland," he said.</p>

    <p>India had lost their first match 4-5 against France on Wednesday. While reflecting on the team's performance so far, Reid said, "We are creating enough opportunities. We need to work on the conversion rate. We are a bit leaky at the back. We need to be stronger and get in front a little more. We were better against Canada. The best way to learn is to make mistakes. We learned from our loss to France. We missed out on this learning phase for a couple of years due to Covid, but it was good we learned quickly."</p>

    <p>Speaking on the prospect of facing strong teams in the knockout stage, the Chief Coach asserted, "If we beat Poland on Saturday, we may face Belgium in the next stage. But to win FIH Odisha Hockey Men's Junior World Cup Bhubaneswar 2021, you must beat everybody. After losing to France, it became clear to us that we have to win every game to win back-to-back titles. It gives us a bit of clarity."</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the team's Vice-Captain Sanjay, who has scored hat-tricks in both of the matches, spoke about his learnings from the tournament so far. He said, "Coaches keep telling us what new techniques we can employ. What other teams are trying out, and I am working on them. Some things are working for me. I also spoke with India Men's Senior Team defender Harmanpreet Singh who gave me some tips."</p>
